## General code style

- use 2 space `indents` and 4 space `continuation indents` for Java and Kotlin, and 2 space for indents & continuation in XML, we're slowing moving to that
- try your best not to exceed horizontal line length
- don't include "created by" tags at top of classes, and if you find one remove it

## Things to do

- write tests for details activity
- re-write remaining classes from Java to Kotlin
- reconsider & improve Dagger2 implementation
- add shared element transition animation to details activity
- re-implement details activity loading
- improve details view layout setup
- use RecyclerView for main grid list
- improve Toolbar show/hide on scroll
